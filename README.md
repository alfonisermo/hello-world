# hello-world
Since retiring, I've forgotten many of the tools I used to use. But I continue to do programming work in my hobby life. I'm re-learning GIT to help me keep track of variouis projects which I tend to leave in various states.<p>
I expect to use GIT for
  - Arduino codes
  - Android projects
  - Project notes & Ideas (and self-assignments)
